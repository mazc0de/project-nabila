export const question17to19 = `Monas or Monumen Nasional, is an iconic symbol of Indonesia's independence and national pride, located in the heart of Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. Standing at a towering height of 132 meters (433 feet), Monas is one of the most recognized landmarks in the country and an essential part of Indonesia's history and cultural identity. The design of Monas was commissioned by Indonesia's first president, Soekarno, who envisioned a monumental structure that would symbolize the spirit of independence and the nation's aspirations for the future. The design was created by the Indonesian architect Freddy Subiantoro, and construction began in 1961 under the direction of Soekarno. The monument was officially inaugurated on July 12, 1975, though the entire complex around Monas, including the surrounding park and museum, took years to complete.`;
