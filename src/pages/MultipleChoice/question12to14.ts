  paragraph: {
    p1: "Mr.Tucker is the headmaster of my school. He does not wear glasses. His eyes always frighten me even when I refuse to face them. They are sharp, hard, and cold, and he uses them like a whip.",
    p2: "He always washes his hands in an enamel basin in the corner of the room. After he has washed them, he will walk over to his desk and stand behind is looking at the pupils while he dries his hands on a small, white towel. He dries each finger separetely, beginning with the first finger. His  fingers are long and white. He rubs them briskly without losing the effect of deliberation and as he rubs them, he looks at us with his eyes.",
    p3: "No one moves while he dries his hands, no one speaks. When he finishes, he will fold the towel and put it in the desk drawer. Then, he will awkwardly smile at us.",
    p4: "He really terrifies me.",
  },
