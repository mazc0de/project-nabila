export const question10to11 = `I am an animal lover. I have various rare and unique pets. One of my favorites is the Syrian hamster. I've been keeping them since 2023. I put my hamster in a fairly large aquarium container. I named him Ochi. Keeping Ochi was an easy job. Hamsters are omnivorous and nocturnal animals. Hamsters have a habit of hoarding food in their cheeks which makes them puffy. In addition, they also like to play around in the cage. Hamsters are sensitive animals and prone to stress. Therefore, hamsters need a comfortable place to live. Inadequate conditions can not only cause stress but also affect their growth. The worst thing is that they may even end up dying.
